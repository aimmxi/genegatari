## About

Genegatari is a tool that allows to render an OpenGL graphical application inside of an SDL window and control parameters of said application with an ImGui menu. It offers a simple way of displaying and controlling graphical OpenGL applications inside of a window. Genegatari handles all the basic initialization functions and paperwork of a graphical application.

Generatari is mainly thought to be a playground to experiment with procedural generation and interesting graphical apps (The so called `Effects`), so it offers a few prebuilt ones to try out of the box: 
* TEST: A simple rotating quadrilateral with controllable speed.
